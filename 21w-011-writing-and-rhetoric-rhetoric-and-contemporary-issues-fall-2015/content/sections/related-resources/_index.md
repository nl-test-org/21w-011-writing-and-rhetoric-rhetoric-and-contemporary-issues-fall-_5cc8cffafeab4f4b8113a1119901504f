### Other Writing Resources

*   [Angles](http://cmsw.mit.edu/publications/angles/)

All of the works published in _Angles_ since its first edition in 2008 were written by students in the introductory writing courses at MIT. These courses, designated as CI-HW![](/images/educator/icon-question-cihw.png) subjects, bring together students who love to write, students who struggle with writing, students who thrive in seminar-style classes, and students who just want a chance to develop their English skills. These students prosper together and produce some remarkable work. _Angles_ has provided them with a public outlet for that work. It also provides the CI-HW instructors with material that inspires and guides their current students.
